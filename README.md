Help me improve


Awesome Project Daniel! It was kinda hard at first but the greater/less than indictors are very helpful! good job adding them! It's also nice that theres a feature for when the user gets the number right the first try. Crediting the user makes them even more engaged, which is a good skill to keep improving!
