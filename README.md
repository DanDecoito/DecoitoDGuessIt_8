Help me improve


Awesome Project Daniel! It was kinda hard at first but the greater/less than indictors are very helpful! good job adding them! It's also nice that theres a feature for when the user gets the number right the first try. Crediting the user makes them even more engaged, which is a good skill to keep improving!

Peer Review: Caroline Hana: It works great the only thing i would change it the difficulty setting maybe add that the range is 1-10 or 1-50 just an indicator so the user knows what they are up for. Other then that the code ran great adn the validations were all good I wasn't able to break the system. nice job!
